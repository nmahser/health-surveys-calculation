# health-surveys-calculation
The goal of this project to automate the calculation of health related surveys. There is a file called `listOfSurveys_beemer.txt`, which includes the surveys that needs to be worked on. The file also includes the links for each survey. These links provide guidelines about how to calculate the surveys scores.
